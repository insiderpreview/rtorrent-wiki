Instead of abusing Tor, here are some alternatives:

* The [Invisible Internet Project (I2P)](https://geti2p.net), yet another
  open-source anonymity network with similar advantages as Tor (e.g.,
  cross-platform, active development, ongoing research) _without_ the burdensome cultural
  baggage and anti-P2P rhetoric. While detailed instructions for doing so exceed
  the mandates of this guide, it may be pertinent to note that:
  * I2P encourages torrent traffic to be routed through the I2P network.
  * I2P comes bundled with a torrent-specific web client for doing so:
    **I2PSnark.**
  * A variety of I2P [eepsites](http://eepsite.com) (i.e., the I2P equivalent of
    [Tor Hidden
    Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tor_hidden_services))
    provide PirateBay-like centralized repositories for hosting I2P-only public
    torrents. Common examples include:
    * [Postman](http://tracker2.postman.i2p).
    * [diftracker](http://diftracker.i2p).
  * [Vuze](https://vuze.com), the proprietary torrent client formerly known as
    Azureus and now functionally indistinguishable from [malware-like
    adware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerus#Criticism), provides the [I2P
    Helper](https://wiki.vuze.com/w/I2PHelper_HowTo) plugin. This plugin is perhaps the only
    remaining reason to install Vuze. It bridges clearnet- and
    I2P-hosted torrents, permitting unanonymous clearnet-hosted torrents to be
    anonymized over I2P _and_ anonymous I2P-hosted torrents to be deanonymized
    over the clearnet. No, we have no idea why anyone would want to deanonymize
    themselves either. Nonetheless, the former feature is _awesome incarnate_.
* Subscribing to a non-free anonymization service supporting both HTTP and UDP
  proxying. Common examples include:
  * [Virtual private network
    (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) providers.
  * [Seedbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox) providers.

Only you can decide your fate.
